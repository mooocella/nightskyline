# nightskyline
I created a city night skyline using turtle. It uses my own modules, loops, and conditions.
  I have separate modules for the individual towers, as well as parts of the street and the moon. I used for loops throughout the project. To incorporate conditions, I made it so a light on one of the buildings stays on if the input is "yes" to wanting to stay awake.
 I defined each differnt tower in Towers.py then in cityliney.py, I made the turtle draw multiple of the towers at different distances apart. So despite only creating 5 towers, the city skyline did not look boring and and too consistent.
  In streetsy.py, I defined the road, lines on the road, and the moon. I decided not to create a new file for the moon because I thought it was unnecessary for just one function.
