# nightskyline
I created a city night skyline using turtle. It uses my own modules, loops, and conditions.
  I have separate modules for the individual towers, as well as parts of the street and the moon. I used for loops throughout the project. To incorporate conditions, I made it so a light on one of the buildings stays on if the input is "yes" to wanting to stay awake.
